# Database_Management
Database Management software written in Java
---------------------------------------------------
I've been working on this project since last month.
It provides user-friendly database management in a fully visual way deeming extended SQL knowledge unnecessary.
Examples of the commands included in this project are create/delete table, selec,insert etc.
Using select command the user can also save the results as a txt file.
